          What is physical therapy and how can it help improve my condition?
        </summary>
        Whether you are recovering from surgery or suffering from a sports or work-related injury, physical therapy focuses on treating or rehabilitating your musculoskeletal system to improve daily functioning and activity. Physical therapy can also help decrease pain and increase flexibility, mobility and strength so you can return to recreational activities and sports.

        Our trained physical therapists take a holistic approach to therapy and create individualized treatment plans to meet the goals of each patient. Your therapist will use hands-on techniques in combination with specific therapeutic exercises and modalities to allow proper healing of injured tissues. Musculoskeletal restrictions or dysfunctions will also be corrected with manual therapy and therapeutic exercises, which allow proper regeneration of soft tissues.

        It is important to contact a physical therapist early on to avoid chronic conditions, which can be the result of injured tissues healing incorrectly.

          What will my first visit consist of?
        </summary>

        When you call to set up your first appointment, we try to gather as much information as possible over the phone in order to decrease your time spent in the waiting area. We also provide all of our necessary forms online so you can come with them completed. Upon arriving at the Center for Physical Therapy, you will be greeted by our patient care staff who will provide you with information about physical therapy and how it can be covered through insurance. Your first visit will be a one-on-one thorough interview with a physical therapist to discuss your medical history and the current injury or source of pain. Your physical therapist will also evaluate your injury or condition using specific, diagnostic assessments. From there, your physical therapist will create a treatment program and discuss it with you, as well as providing written information about the treatment and care. The first visit usually lasts about an hour with additional time for paperwork if needed.

          What should I wear?
        </summary>

        It depends on the nature of your injury; however, we suggest you dress comfortably. You are welcome to bring a change of clothing if necessary to allow access to the area that needs to be treated. Shorts are great for knee, ankle or foot conditions. Women could wear a sports bra for neck or shoulder conditions. We also provide medical gowns to allow exposure to the neck or low back (for better inspection).
